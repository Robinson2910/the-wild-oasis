to reuse piece of ui we use components and props

props acts as an api ,which is exposed to user

children prop can be used to customize content

Custom hooks are used for reusuing stateful logic

to reuse ui and stateful logic

we have two advanced patters

1.Render props pattern

user of component has complete control over what the component actually renders,by passing in a function that tells component what to render

was more common before hooks but still useful

So the render prop pattern is all

about passing in a prop called render,

which is a function that a component uses

to know what it should render and how to do it.

2.Compound component pattern

For very self contained components taht need/want to manage their fancy super-components
